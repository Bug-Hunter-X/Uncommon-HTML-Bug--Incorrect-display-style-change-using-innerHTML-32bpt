# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect display style change using innerHTML

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to changing the display style of an HTML element using innerHTML.  The bug arises from an incorrect approach to hiding an element, where innerHTML is used to modify the style attribute, potentially leading to unintended behavior and making the code difficult to maintain.

## Bug Description
The provided HTML code attempts to hide the content of a div with the id "myDiv". However, the approach uses `innerHTML` to insert a new div element with a `style='display:none'` attribute.  This is an inefficient and potentially problematic way to hide the element.

## Solution
The solution uses the more efficient and reliable `style.display = "none"` method. This directly manipulates the element's style property, ensuring correct display behavior.

## How to reproduce the bug
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that the intended behavior of hiding the initial text within "myDiv" is not achieved correctly with the use of innerHTML.

## How the solution works
1. Open `bugSolution.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe that the text is correctly hidden by modifying the `style.display` directly.  This cleaner approach is easier to understand and maintain.

## Additional Notes
This example highlights the importance of using the appropriate methods for manipulating the DOM and setting element styles. Directly modifying the `style` property is generally preferred for simplicity, efficiency, and consistency.
